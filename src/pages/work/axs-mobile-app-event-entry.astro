<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>AXS is a leading event ticketing platform with over 50 million ticket sales annually across 30,000+ global events, generating $2 billion in sales volume. </p>

							<p>The AXS mobile app, required for event entry, serves <strong>55 million yearly users</strong> and powers ticketing in 28 client apps including Coachella, Firefly Festival, the LA Lakers, and Wembley Stadium.</p>
							
							<p>Despite its reach, the app and ticketing functionality hadnâ€™t meaningfully changed in over seven years. I was brought on to lead a research-based redesign effort.</p>
							
							<h3>My role</h3>

							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>UX & product strategy:</strong> Led UX discovery, design strategy, and end-to-end UX design. Collaborated closely with two visual designers, offering feedback and support while aligning with the overall vision. Stepped into a product leadership role in the absence of a PM, driving stakeholder engagement and shaping the overall product direction.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Lean research:</strong> 
									Initiated and led both qualitative and quantitative research efforts with minimal resources, collaborating with two UX peers to uncover insights that directly shaped design decisions and product priorities.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Engineering partner:</strong> Worked closely with engineers to keep development on track and ensure the final product matched the designs in functionality, visual detail, and animation. 
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Streamlined event entry on day of event</h3>
