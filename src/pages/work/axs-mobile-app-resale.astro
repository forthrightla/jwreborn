<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>AXS is a leading event ticketing platform with over 50 million ticket sales annually across 30,000+ global events, generating $2 billion in sales volume. </p>

							<p>The AXS mobile app, required for event entry, serves 55 million users yearly and powers ticketing in 28 client apps including Coachella, Firefly Festival, the LA Lakers, and Wembley Stadium.</p>
							
							<p>Despite its reach, the app and ticketing functionality hadnâ€™t meaningfully changed in over seven years. I was brought on to lead a research-based redesign effort.</p>
							

						<h3>My role</h3>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Product strategy</strong> As Principal Designer,
								I partnered closely with the VPs of Marketing, Creative,
								and UX to determine product strategy.
							</li>
							
							<li>
								<strong>Research:</strong> 
								I proposed and led all qualitative and quantitative research on a shoestring budget, working closely with two additional UX designers
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Engineering:</strong> I worked closely with
								our engineers to ensure velocity as well as 1:1 parity
								with shipped designs. This included functionality,
								look and feel, and animation.
							</li>
						</ul>
