							Background
						</h2>

						<p>
							LegalZoom is a $5B legal technology company with a mission to democratize entrepreneurship. It has formed 3.7M+ businesses since its inception, and went public in June 2021.</p>

<p>LegalZoom’s business formation product accounts for almost half of the company’s revenue, and leadership had been hesitant to take big risks on changing the product offering or experience.

						</p>

						<p>
							I led design for a new internal startup team tasked with reimagining the formation flow. Our goal was to build a fast, intuitive, and welcoming experience for a downmarket audience. We worked independently from legacy systems to move quickly and explore a new freemium model.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 4 weeks <br>
							<strong>Team:</strong> 2 designers, 2 engineers, PM, VP stakeholders<br>
							<strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, Mural</p>
						<p></p>

						<h3 id="my-role">My role</h3>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Product strategy:</strong> As Principal Designer,
								I partnered closely with the VPs of Marketing, Creative,
								and UX to determine product strategy.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>UX and Product design:</strong> I co-led the design of the full experience with another designer. Together, we developed a new design system, crafted end-to-end user flows, and established a distinct visual identity.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Engineering collaboration:</strong> I partnered daily with engineers to maintain fidelity in layout, animation, and overall functionality.
							</li>
						</ul>
						

						<p></p>
						<h2>The challenge</h2>

						<p>
							To differentiate the Ribbon experience from
							LegalZoom’s typical customer, we decided to target
							downmarket customers with a free business formation
							experience. To visualize this, I put together a
							competitive landscape diagram.
						</p>

						</p>

						<p></p>

						<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>

						<p>
							To meet the project's tight timeline, I relied on informed assumptions grounded in existing research and design insights. This approach incorporated competitive analyses, proto-personas, customer journey maps, and reference designs from similar projects that had been validated through usability and demand testing.
						</p>

						<p></p>

						<h3 id="first-i-determine-the-information-architecture">
							First, I determine the information architecture
						</h3>

						<p>
							After multiple collaborative discussions with key stakeholders, I refined the focus to a core set of key pages. I then mapped out these pages in a clear and concise format to ensure alignment and easy understanding for the team.
