        <h3>I design meaningful products that have real impact.</h3>
        <p>
          For over 10 years I've had the privilege to serve tens
          of millions of users, collaborating with diverse
          cross-functional teams and executive leadership to
          identify and solve complex problems. I've led design
          initiatives for top brands like Indeed, AXS, and
          LegalZoom, and thrive at the intersection of business and
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an instructor and the Assistant Managing Director at the
          <a href="http://ac4d.com" target="_blank">Austin Center for Design (AC4D)</a>, I strive to empower the next
          generation of designers to tackle complex societal
          challenges with creativity and autonomy. Additionally, I serve on
          the <a href="https://sopa.tulane.edu/about-sopa/advisory-boards/media-design-advisory-board" target="_blank">Media &amp; Design Advisory Board</a> for Tulane University's School of Professional Advancement, 
          helping to refine and shape a design curriculum that meets
          the constantly evolving needs of the field.
