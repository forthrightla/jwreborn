					<h3>I design meaningful products that have real impact.</h3>
					<p>
						For over 10 years I've had the privilege to serve tens
						of millions of users, collaborating with diverse
						cross-functional teams and executive leadership to
						identify and solve complex problems. Iâ€™ve led design
						initiatives for top brands like Indeed, AXS, and
						LegalZoom, and thrive at the intersection of business and
						design.
					</p>
					<p>
						As an instructor and the Assistant Managing Director at the
						<a href="http://ac4d.com" target="_blank">Austin Center for Design (AC4D)</a>, I strive to empower the next
						generation of designers to tackle complex societal
						challenges with creativity and autonomy. Additionally, I serve on
						the <a href="https://sopa.tulane.edu/about-sopa/advisory-boards/media-design-advisory-board" target="_blank">Media &amp; Design Advisory Board</a> for Tulane University's School of Professional Advancement, 
						helping to refine and shape a design curriculum that meets
						the constantly evolving needs of the field.
					</p>
