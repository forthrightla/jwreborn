## Summary

LegalZoom is a $5B legal technology leader that has formed over 3.7M businesses since launch. With nearly half its revenue coming from business formation, leadership was understandably cautious about experimenting with the core product.

I led UX for Ribbon, a cross-functional stealth startup created to test what leadership couldn't risk on the main product: offering business formation for free. We had complete freedom to reimagine pricing, visual design, and funnel structure. We were essentially building a competitor to our own product to see if freemium could work.

Through rapid experimentation and user research, we **validated key hypotheses about progressive disclosure, trust-building, and conversion optimization** that influenced product thinking across the organization.

## Background

### The challenge

LegalZoom's business formation product generates almost half the company's revenue, but the existing experience required users to answer 23 pages of detailed questions before purchase. This created significant drop-off and user frustration.

Leadership was hesitant to take risks with such a critical product. They needed a way to test new ideas without disrupting the core business.

### The opportunity

Enter Ribbon: a stealth startup with autonomy to test what seemed unthinkable for a company that charged $79+ for formation. We would offer it for free and see what happened. Our mission was to discover if freemium could work, then bring those insights back to the main product.

### My role

As Principal Designer, I partnered closely with the VPs of Marketing, Creative, and UX to determine product strategy. Working alongside another Product Designer, we pair-designed the entire experience from top to bottom, developing both a design system and visual language. I also worked closely with engineering to ensure velocity and 1:1 parity with shipped designs.

## Discovery & strategy

### Understanding the market landscape

Our competitive analysis revealed where LegalZoom sat in the market. We positioned Ribbon to explore the "high value, low cost" quadrant to offer a premium experience at accessible prices.

### Research constraints and approach

With only four weeks to deliver, we had to make informed assumptions based on existing research. This included competitive analyses of 13+ competitors, proto-personas based on customer data, customer journey maps from previous studies, and mothballed designs that had been previously tested.

### The hypothesis: Progressive disclosure

Based on our research synthesis, I proposed a fundamental shift in approach. Instead of requiring all information upfront, we would ask easy questions first, building trust progressively through the experience. This was especially important for a freemium model, where the goal shifted from immediate purchase to building enough engagement that users would add paid services later.

## Design process

### Rapid prototyping

I started by mapping the existing flow and identifying where to cut. The key insight: complex questions could move to after purchase, when users were already committed.

Working in tandem with my design partner, we moved from sketches to high-fidelity designs in days. Every design decision was annotated for engineering clarity.

### Creating Thread: Our design system

We developed a comprehensive design system called Thread, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining consistency. This became the foundation for all Ribbon designs and allowed us to move quickly without sacrificing quality.

### Brand identity emerges

The visual design balanced playfulness with professionalism, using illustrations and animations to reduce anxiety around legal processes. We wanted to make business formation feel accessible, not intimidating.

## Key design decisions

### Simplified entry experience

Instead of overwhelming users with forms, we started with a single, friendly question: "Where do you want to form your business?" This immediately reduced bounce rates and set a conversational tone.

### Building trust through transparency

We designed each step to clearly communicate value. Users understood exactly what they were getting and why each piece of information was needed. No hidden fees, no surprises.

## Validation

We launched with limited AdWords traffic, capping orders at 40 to avoid overwhelming our third-party vendor. Despite being an unknown brand competing against LegalZoom itself, we saw promising early conversion.

Between test cycles, we analyzed drop-off points and optimized the flow. Conversion improved 28% after clarifying value propositions and simplifying the question sequence. This gave us enough signal to present findings to leadership and created a recruiting pool for ongoing research.

## Results and organizational impact

### Influencing the broader organization

While Ribbon operated independently, our findings influenced thinking across LegalZoom. The project demonstrated that freemium could generate real conversions without cannibalizing the core business, giving leadership confidence to explore the model further. Our approach to progressive disclosure and trust-building became a reference point for other teams.

Our validated principles influenced thinking across LegalZoom:

- **Progressive disclosure reduces drop-off.** This initiated projects to simplify the main funnel.
- **Friendly language improves trust.** Content strategy shifted across products.
- **Visual delight reduces anxiety.** Animation guidelines were added to the design system.

## Reflection

Ribbon proved that sometimes the best way to improve a product is to pretend you're competing with it. That outside perspective, combined with inside knowledge, created conditions for insights that wouldn't have emerged from incremental optimization.

The project also demonstrated that innovation doesn't require massive resources. Just the freedom to experiment and learn quickly.
