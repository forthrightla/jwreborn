## Summary

<ProjectDetails 
goal="Test innovative approaches to business formation experiences"
responsibilities="UX design, rapid experimentation, user research"
duration="4 weeks"
/>

LegalZoom is a $5B legal technology leader that has formed over 3.7M businesses since launch. With nearly half its revenue coming from business formation, leadership was understandably cautious about experimenting with the core product.

I led UX for Ribbon, a cross-functional innovation team created to explore new approaches outside the constraints of legacy systems. We had complete freedom to reimagine pricing, visual design, funnel structure, and product offerings—essentially building a competitor to our own product to uncover insights.

Through rapid experimentation and user research, we <strong>validated key hypotheses about progressive disclosure, trust-building, and conversion optimization</strong> that influenced product thinking across the organization.

## Background

### The challenge

LegalZoom's traditional LLC formation funnel required users to complete lengthy forms upfront before understanding the full value proposition. This created significant drop-off at critical points in the experience.

The Ribbon team was tasked with exploring: Could we fundamentally reimagine this experience without the constraints of existing technical debt or business rules?

### How LegalZoom's LLC conversion funnel worked at the time

### The hypothesis: Progressive commitment

Based on competitive research and behavioral psychology, I proposed testing whether we could increase completion rates by:
- Starting with low-commitment questions
- Building trust progressively through the experience
- Deferring complex decisions until users were invested

### My role

- **Product strategy:** Partnered with VPs of Marketing, Creative, and UX to define experiment parameters
- **UX and Product design:** Co-led the complete design process, from information architecture to final UI
- **Research synthesis:** Conducted user interviews and translated findings into actionable insights

## Process

### Rapid experimentation approach

With only 4 weeks to build and test, we adopted a lean methodology:

**Week 1:** Information architecture and core flow design

**Week 2:** High-fidelity design and engineering handoff

**Week 3:** Build and internal testing

**Week 4:** Launch with paid traffic and begin user research

### Key design decisions

**Simplified entry point**
Rather than asking for business details immediately, we started with a simple question: "What type of business are you starting?" This reduced cognitive load and increased initial engagement.

**Trust through transparency**
We designed clear value propositions at each step, explaining why we needed information and what users would receive. The dashboard experience reinforced this value post-purchase.

## Testing and insights

### Research methodology

After launching with AdWords traffic, I conducted:
- 12 user interviews with customers who completed the flow
- 8 interviews with users who abandoned
- Comparative analysis against the traditional experience

### Key findings

**What worked:**
- Progressive disclosure significantly reduced perceived complexity
- Users appreciated understanding costs upfront
- Simplified language improved comprehension and trust

**What needed improvement:**
- Some users wanted more educational content mid-flow
- Pricing transparency could come even earlier
- Mobile experience needed optimization for form completion

### Validated design patterns

Through iteration, we identified reusable patterns:

1. **Question sequencing:** Easy → Personal → Financial → Complex
2. **Trust signals:** Security badges after sensitive questions, not randomly placed
3. **Progress indicators:** Showing time investment ("2 min left") over step counts
4. **Value reinforcement:** Contextual benefits shown at friction points

## Impact and influence

### Organizational learning

While Ribbon operated independently, our findings influenced thinking across LegalZoom:

- **Progressive disclosure** became a discussed principle in design reviews
- **Simplified language** initiatives emerged in other product areas
- **Freemium exploration** gained traction as a viable business model

### Design system contributions

Elements from Ribbon's visual design—particularly our approach to form design and error handling—were adopted by other teams looking to modernize their experiences.

### Personal growth

This project taught me the value of protected innovation spaces. By removing the pressure of immediate ROI, we could explore bolder solutions and generate insights that wouldn't emerge from incremental optimization.

## Reflection

Ribbon proved that even established products with millions of users can benefit from fundamental rethinking. The key wasn't just the specific solutions we tested, but demonstrating a methodology for rapid experimentation that balanced speed with rigor.

Most importantly, it showed that sometimes the best way to improve a product is to pretend you're competing with it. That outside perspective, combined with inside knowledge, creates the conditions for breakthrough insights.
