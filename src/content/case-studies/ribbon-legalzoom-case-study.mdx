## Summary


<ProjectDetails 
goal="Identify high‑impact improvements for our flagship product"
responsibilities="UX design, rapid ideation"
duration="4 weeks"
/>

LegalZoom is a $5B legal technology leader dedicated to democratizing entrepreneurship. Having formed over 3.7M businesses since launch and going public in June 2021, nearly half its revenue comes from its core business formation product. Given the product’s significance, leadership was cautious about making substantial changes to the experience or offerings.

I led UX for a cross-functional team spun up to operate like a startup within the organization. We were tasked with experimenting freely with pricing, visual design, funnel structure, and product offerings, without constraints from legacy systems.

Insights and recommendations from these experiments were successfully integrated into LegalZoom’s flagship product, resulting in an <strong>8% increase in conversion</strong>.

## Background

### My role

- **Product strategy:** As Principal Designer, I partnered closely with the VPs of Marketing, Creative, and UX to determine product strategy.
- **UX and Product design:** I co-led the design of the full experience with another designer. Together, we developed a new design system, crafted end-to-end user flows, and established a distinct visual identity.
- **Engineering collaboration:** I partnered daily with engineers to maintain fidelity in layout, animation, and overall functionality.

### My approach

To move quickly, I relied on informed assumptions drawn from existing research and prior design work. I referenced competitive analyses, proto-personas, customer journey maps, and archived, tested designs from similar projects.

### The hypothesis: a better way
Based on competitive research and user behavior, I believed that starting with simpler questions and saving the more complex ones for after checkout would reduce drop-off and improve conversion.

### First, I determine the information architecture

After multiple collaborative discussions with key stakeholders, I refined the focus to a core set of key pages. I then mapped out these pages in a clear and concise format to ensure alignment and easy understanding for the team.

### Next, establishing baseline layout and functionality

Paired closely with a talented UI designer, we developed the branding, look and feel, and aesthetics of the Ribbon brand.
