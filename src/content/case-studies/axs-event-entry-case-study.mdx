## Summary

<ProjectDetails 
goal="Reduce event entry friction, increase customer understanding"
responsibilities="UX design, customer research, product strategy"
duration="6 months"
/>

The AXS mobile app powers event ticketing experiences for over 55 million people annually across major venues and events like Coachella, LA Lakers games, and Wembley Stadium.

I led a research-driven redesign focused on solving a critical problem: the "AXS Mobile ID" (a QR code used for multiple purposes) was confusing customers and creating friction at event entry. Through extensive research and testing, I discovered that the solution required adding *intentional* friction. We needed to provide context before showing the code, which contradicted internal assumptions but ultimately <strong>improved event entry success by 68% and reduced support calls by 42%</strong>.

## Background

### The challenge

The AXS Mobile ID is a QR code that serves multiple purposes:
- Event entry (like a ticket)
- Payment method at concessions
- Account identification

Leadership believed customers would intuitively understand these different uses. As a band-aid fix for confusion, they had implemented an aggressive solution: automatically displaying the Mobile ID every time the app opened, regardless of whether users had tickets.

This only deepened customer confusion and frustration.

### The internal bias

There was a strong organizational belief that:
- "Mobile ID" was self-explanatory
- Customers would understand a single QR code could serve multiple purposes
- Any additional steps would create unwanted friction

My research would prove all three assumptions wrong.

### My role

I led UX discovery and product strategy, stepping into product leadership when we lost our PM early in the project. With limited resources, I drove lean research to uncover insights that would challenge organizational assumptions and inform our design decisions.

## Discovery 

### Key research questions

<EnhancedOutcomeGrid 
  outcomes={[
    {
      description: "Why don't users understand the AXS Mobile ID despite repeated exposure?",
      variant: "text-only",
      colorClass: "primary"
    },
    {
      description: "What context do users need to confidently use different QR code functions?",
      variant: "text-only",
      colorClass: "primary"
    }
  ]}
  columns={2}
/>

### Competitive analysis

I analyzed 13 apps across different categories to understand QR code implementation patterns:

<Table
  headers={['Category', 'Apps', 'Key Finding', 'User Understanding']}
  data={[
    ['Events', 'Ticketmaster, Seatgeek', 'QR codes tied to specific tickets', 'High - clear context'],
    ['Rewards', 'Starbucks, Chipotle', 'Single purpose, prominent placement', 'High - one function'],
    ['Payments', 'Venmo, PayPal', 'Clear labels like "Scan to pay"', 'High - action-oriented']
  ]}
/>

**Critical insight:** Successful apps always provide context *before* displaying QR codes, never assuming users understand their purpose.

### User testing round 1: Validating the problem

**Setup:** 40 participants, 2 test variations

<Table
  headers={['Test Condition', 'User Behavior', 'Success Rate', 'Key Quote']}
  data={[
    ['Current app with "Mobile ID"', 'Users avoided the feature entirely', '12%', '"Mobile ID means nothing to me"'],
    ['QR code shown on app open', 'Users closed it immediately, confused', '8%', '"Why is this popping up? I don\'t have tickets"']
  ]}
  variant="compact"
/>

**Key findings:**
- The term "Mobile ID" had zero meaning to users
- Showing the code without context created anxiety
- Users at events are stressed and need clarity, not clever naming

### User testing round 2: Testing solutions

**New hypothesis:** Adding context before showing the code would improve understanding, even if it added a tap.

<Table
  headers={['Solution Tested', 'Change Made', 'Success Rate', 'Key Learning']}
  data={[
    ['Contextual labels', 'Changed "Mobile ID" to "Entry Pass" for events', '78%', 'Functional names work'],
    ['Preview screens', 'Added screen explaining what users would see next', '81%', 'Context reduces anxiety'],
    ['Visual cues', 'Showed event name and "Tap to enter" before code', '89%', 'Specificity builds confidence']
  ]}
  variant="compact"
/>

## The solution

### Design principle: Context before code

Instead of fighting user mental models, we'd work with them. Every QR code appearance would be preceded by clear context about its purpose.

**The framework:**
1. User initiates an action (view tickets, pay, etc.)
2. We explain what they'll see and why
3. QR code appears with reinforcing context

This approach scales for any future use while reducing cognitive load in the moment.

### Implementation examples

**For event entry:**
- User taps on their ticket
- Screen shows: "Ready to enter [Event Name]?" with venue map
- QR code appears with "Scan this at the gate" message

**For payments:**
- User initiates payment flow
- Screen explains: "Pay with your phone at concessions"
- QR code appears with "Scan to pay" label

**For account access:**
- User goes to account settings
- Their name appears prominently next to their personal QR code
- Clear explanation: "This code is unique to your account"

### New feature: "Day of" event entry

The contextual approach enabled us to create a streamlined entry experience that users actually understood:

## Results and reflection

### The power of good friction

This project proved that not all friction is bad. By adding one thoughtful step (context before code) we:
- Increased successful event entry by 68%
- Reduced support calls by 42%
- Improved app store ratings significantly

### Challenging assumptions

The biggest challenge wasn't the design. It was overcoming organizational bias. Leadership's assumption that users would "figure it out" was costing millions in support costs and damaging the brand.

By grounding every decision in user research and being persistent with data, we transformed a confusing experience into one that actually works for the millions of fans who use it.

The lesson? Sometimes the best UX decision is to slow users down just enough to help them succeed.
