## Background

AXS is a leading event ticketing platform with over 50 million ticket sales annually across 30,000+ global events, generating $2 billion in sales volume.

The AXS mobile app, required for event entry, serves **55 million yearly users** and powers ticketing in 28 client apps including Coachella, Firefly Festival, the LA Lakers, and Wembley Stadium.

Despite its reach, the app and ticketing functionality hadn't meaningfully changed in over seven years. I was brought on to lead a research-based redesign effort.

### My role

- **UX & product strategy:** Led UX discovery, design strategy, and end-to-end UX design. Collaborated closely with two visual designers, offering feedback and support while aligning with the overall vision. Stepped into a product leadership role in the absence of a PM, driving stakeholder engagement and shaping the overall product direction.

- **Lean research:** Initiated and led both qualitative and quantitative research efforts with minimal resources, collaborating with two UX peers to uncover insights that directly shaped design decisions and product priorities.

- **Engineering partner:** Worked closely with engineers to keep development on track and ensure the final product matched the designs in functionality, visual detail, and animation.

### Streamlined event entry on day of event
