## Background

AXS is a leading event ticketing platform with over 50 million ticket sales annually across 30,000+ global events, generating $2 billion in sales volume.

The AXS mobile app, required for event entry, serves **55 million yearly users** and powers ticketing in 28 client apps including Coachella, Firefly Festival, the LA Lakers, and Wembley Stadium.

Despite its reach, the app and ticketing functionality hadn't meaningfully changed in over seven years. I was brought on to lead a research-based redesign effort.

### My role

**UX & product strategy**  
Led UX discovery, design strategy, and end-to-end UX design. Collaborated closely with two visual designers, offering feedback and support while aligning with the overall vision. Stepped into a product leadership role in the absence of a PM, driving stakeholder engagement and shaping the overall product direction.

**Lean research**  
Initiated and led both qualitative and quantitative research efforts with minimal resources, collaborating with two UX peers to uncover insights that directly shaped design decisions and product priorities.

**Engineering partner**  
Worked closely with engineers to keep development on track and ensure the final product matched the designs in functionality, visual detail, and animation.

## The challenge

The AXS Mobile ID (a QR code for event entry) was confusing users. Customer service flagged it as a top support issue. Meanwhile, stakeholders wanted the Mobile ID shown automatically 100% of the time.

**The core question:** How do we make this feature intuitive for millions of users while building for future functionality?

## Discovery process

### Research questions

I focused on three areas:
1. How do other apps use QR codes?
2. Do users understand "Mobile ID"?
3. Where should the Mobile ID live?

### Competitive analysis

I analyzed 13 apps across different categories:

<Table
  headers={['Category', 'Apps', 'QR Code Placement', 'Context Provided', 'Taps to QR Code']}
  data={[
    ['Events', 'Ticketmaster, Seatgeek, Vividseats', 'Tied to tickets', 'Context at each step', '2'],
    ['Rewards', 'Starbucks, Chipotle', 'Front and center', 'Minimal', '0-1'],
    ['Payments', 'Venmo, PayPal', 'Multiple locations', 'Clear labels ("Get Paid")', '2']
  ]}
/>

**Key insight:** Similar apps require 2 taps to QR codes, providing context at each step.

### User testing round 1

**Setup:** 40 participants, 2 test variations

<Table
  headers={['Variation', 'User Behavior', 'Success Rate', 'Key Quote']}
  data={[
    ['Button labeled "Mobile ID"', 'Clicked event card instead', 'Low', '"Mobile ID means nothing"'],
    ['Unlabeled QR code', 'Associated code with tickets but confused by multiple uses', 'Medium', '"I had no idea where to click"']
  ]}
  variant="compact"
/>

**Takeaways:**
- "Mobile ID" as a term was not understood by participants
- Using a QR code for multiple purposes was confusing
- Familiar patterns matter under stress

### User testing round 2

**New hypothesis:** Context before code reduces friction

<Table
  headers={['Test', 'Approach', 'Success Rate', 'User Feedback']}
  data={[
    ['C', '"Entry Pass" with context', '90%', '"It looks like a barcode which I would assume would be scanned"'],
    ['D', '"Mobile ID" with context', 'Low', '"Mobile ID rather than Ticket(s) made me think twice"']
  ]}
  variant="compact"
/>

## The solution

### Design principle: Context before code

Most users download the app right before events (high stress moment). Instead of teaching "Mobile ID," we provide clear context for each use.

**The framework:**
1. User starts action (view tickets, pay, etc.)
2. Clear label explains the QR code purpose
3. Mobile ID appears with context

This scales for future features like mobile ordering while reducing cognitive load.

### Streamlined event entry on day of event

## Impact

**By the numbers:**

<Table
  headers={['Metric', 'Result']}
  data={[
    ['Event entry success rate', '+68%'],
    ['App-based ticket revenue', '+13%'],
    ['iOS App Store rating', '4.7 stars (361K reviews)']
  ]}
  variant="striped"
/>

**Beyond metrics:**
- Fewer customer service tickets
- Scalable patterns for new features
- Better experience for 55M+ users

## Key learnings

**Users don't learn under pressure**  
Design for existing mental models, especially during stressful moments like event entry.

**Context beats education**  
Don't teach terminology. Show features when users already understand why they need them.

**One code, one purpose**  
Multi-purpose QR codes confuse users regardless of labeling.

**Patterns matter**  
Users bring expectations from other apps. Work with them, not against them.

## Reflection

This project showed why challenging internal assumptions matters. Stakeholders thought "Mobile ID" was self-explanatory. Testing proved otherwise. By focusing on user mental models over internal terminology, we built something that actually works for people.
