      ## The Client
      
      Cerebral is a $4.8B mental health care startup focused on destigmatizing mental health and bringing accessible and affordable therapy and medication to all.
      
      ## My Role
      
      I was engaged as a consultant to conduct an in-depth research study, including auditing the existing product experience and developing a comprehensive Customer Journey Map to guide the creation of a two-year product roadmap.
      
      ## The Challenge
      
      The company needed to ensure their product roadmap was informed by robust customer research and insights, but lacked foundational understanding of their customers' experiences.

  - title: "Research Methodology"
    content: |
      ## Approach
      
      We developed a research protocol synthesized from executive stakeholder input and customer service team interviews to determine common issues. Then conducted seven 45-minute participatory interviews via Zoom with active customers to gather insights.
      
      ## Participants
      
      We screened for active Cerebral customers who had renewed their subscriptions at least once, engaged with a clinician in the last 30 days, and responded to a prior survey expressing interest in participation.
      
      ## Key Insights
      
      - **Cerebral customers are looking for someone to trust** — When addressing their mental health, individuals often have deeply personal goals. This vulnerable moment requires trust and support from the people and systems they rely on.
      
      - **There is no 'one size fits all'** — Customers seek personalized treatment plans and trust in expert recommendations. They are open to trying services if the benefits are clear but may look elsewhere if they feel they're paying for unnecessary offerings.
      
      - **Connection gives customers hope for the future** — When customers connect with a person or with a diagnosis, they learn to understand & eventually accept themselves more easily. Empathic exchanges and diagnoses offer context to what feels wrong.
