## Summary

<ProjectDetails 
goal="Uncover experience gaps to inform the 2-year roadmap"
responsibilities="ethnographic customer research, product strategy"
duration="1 month"
/>

Cerebral is a $4.8B mental health startup focused on accessible, affordable therapy and medication. I led their first comprehensive research initiative to understand how customers experienced the product and what they needed most.

Working as a consultant, I interviewed active customers, mapped their journeys, and delivered insights that shaped the next two years of product development. The recommendations led to a **26% increase in customer satisfaction** and convinced leadership to build an internal research team.

## Research approach

### Participants

![Participant demographics](/images/case-studies/cerebral-participants.png)

I interviewed seven active Cerebral customers who had renewed their subscriptions and recently engaged with clinicians. Each brought unique perspectives on mental health care needs.

### Method

Starting with stakeholder interviews and customer service data, I identified the most critical questions to explore. The 45-minute sessions used participatory techniques to understand not just what customers did, but why they made those choices.

## Key insights

  insight="Cerebral customers are looking for someone to trust."
  context="This vulnerable moment requires empathy and support. Customers arrive with deeply personal goals that go beyond simple healthcare transactions."
  recommendationTitle="Extend a helping hand"
  recommendation="Build trust from the first interaction. Show empathetic communication, introduce clinicians personally, and clearly explain how Cerebral can help with individual goals."

  recommendationTitle="Bespoke treatment plans"
  recommendation="Create collaborative planning that lets customers shape their care. Explain service benefits clearly and offer flexible options so customers only pay for what they need."

  insight="Connection gives customers hope for the future."
  context="When customers connect with the right clinician or receive a diagnosis that explains their experiences, they gain hope. Both empathy and understanding help people accept themselves and envision improvement."
  recommendationTitle="Facilitate a 'sigh of relief'"
  recommendation="Train clinicians to deliver personalized, empathetic responses. Create accessible resources that explain diagnoses in relatable terms and highlight paths to improvement."
/>

## Deliverables

### Customer journey map

I created a comprehensive journey map documenting customer emotions, actions, touchpoints, and opportunities throughout their Cerebral experience. This became a reference tool for product and design decisions.

### Organizational impact

We presented findings to both the core team and company leadership. The research resonated strongly, leading to immediate action on several recommendations and the decision to invest in a dedicated research function.

The detailed shareout document distributed company-wide ensured insights reached every team that could benefit from deeper customer understanding.
