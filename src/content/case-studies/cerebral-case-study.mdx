## Summary

<ProjectDetails 
goal="Uncover experience gaps to inform the 2-year roadmap"
responsibilities="ethnographic customer research, product strategy"
duration="1 month"
/>

Cerebral is a $4.8B mental health startup focused on accessible, affordable therapy and medication. I led their first comprehensive research initiative to understand how customers experienced the product and what they needed most.

Working as a consultant, I interviewed active customers, mapped their journeys, and delivered insights that shaped the next two years of product development. The recommendations led to a **26% increase in customer satisfaction** and convinced leadership to build an internal research team.

## Research approach

### Participants



I interviewed seven active Cerebral customers who had renewed their subscriptions and recently engaged with clinicians. Each brought unique perspectives on mental health care needs.

### Methodology

Starting with stakeholder interviews and customer service data, I identified the most critical questions to explore. The 45-minute sessions used participatory techniques to understand not just what customers did, but why they made those choices.

## Key insights

  recommendation="Create collaborative planning that lets customers shape their care. Explain service benefits clearly and offer flexible options so customers only pay for what they need."

  recommendationTitle="Facilitate a 'sigh of relief'"
  recommendation="Train clinicians to deliver personalized, empathetic responses. Create accessible resources that explain diagnoses in relatable terms and highlight paths to improvement."
/>

## Results and impact

### Research synthesis

We created a comprehensive journey map documenting customer emotions, actions, touchpoints, and opportunities throughout their Cerebral experience. This became a reference tool for product and design decisions.

### Company-wide influence

We presented the research findings to teams across the company, from product and design to leadership and customer success. Each presentation sparked different questions, but the core message remained consistent: Cerebral customers needed empathy, flexibility, and genuine connection.

The insights directly shaped how Cerebral prioritized their 2-year product roadmap. Rather than guessing what features to build next, the team could now point to specific customer needs and stories to guide their decisions.

### Establishing a research practice

Perhaps most significantly, this research convinced leadership to hire Cerebral's first dedicated research team. They recognized that understanding their customers wasn't a one-time project but an ongoing necessity for a company serving such vulnerable moments in people's lives.

Looking back, I'm proud that this work helped Cerebral move from assumptions to evidence. In mental health care, that shift matters.
