## Summary

Cerebral is a $4.8B mental health startup focused on accessible, affordable therapy and medication. I led their first comprehensive research initiative to understand how customers experienced the product and what they needed most.

I interviewed active customers, mapped their journeys, and delivered insights that shaped the next two years of product development. The recommendations led to a **26% increase in customer satisfaction** and convinced leadership to build an internal research team.

## Background

### The challenge

Cerebral had grown rapidly to a $4.8B valuation, but product decisions were being made without systematic customer understanding. Leadership was estimating priorities for the roadmap, and there was no internal research function to validate assumptions.

### My role

I was brought in as a consultant to lead Cerebral's first comprehensive research initiative. Working with the Head of Design, I scoped the study, brought in a second researcher to partner with, and managed our team through interviews, synthesis, and final presentations to leadership and cross-functional teams.

## Approach

Our team interviewed seven active Cerebral customers who had renewed their subscriptions and recently engaged with clinicians. Starting with stakeholder interviews and customer service data, I identified the most critical questions to explore. The 45-minute sessions used participatory techniques to understand not just what customers did, but why they made those choices.

  recommendationTitle="Extend a helping hand"
  recommendation="Build trust from the first interaction. Show empathetic communication, introduce clinicians personally, and clearly explain how Cerebral can help with individual goals."

  recommendationTitle="Bespoke treatment plans"
  recommendation="Create collaborative planning that lets customers shape their care. Explain service benefits clearly and offer flexible options so customers only pay for what they need."

  insight="Connection gives customers hope for the future."
  context="When customers connect with the right clinician or receive a diagnosis that explains their experiences, they gain hope. Both empathy and understanding help people accept themselves and envision improvement."
  recommendationTitle="Facilitate a 'sigh of relief'"
  recommendation="Train clinicians to deliver personalized, empathetic responses. Create accessible resources that explain diagnoses in relatable terms and highlight paths to improvement."
/>

## Results and impact

### Research synthesis

I led the synthesis of our findings into a comprehensive journey map documenting customer emotions, actions, touchpoints, and opportunities throughout their Cerebral experience. This became a reference tool for product and design decisions.

### Company-wide influence

The insights directly shaped Cerebral's 2-year product roadmap. Rather than estimating what features to build next, teams across product, design, and customer success could now point to specific customer needs to guide their decisions.

### Establishing a research practice

This research convinced leadership to hire Cerebral's first dedicated research team. They recognized that understanding their customers wasn't a one-time project but an ongoing necessity for a company serving vulnerable moments in people's lives.
