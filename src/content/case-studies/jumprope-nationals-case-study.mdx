## Summary

<ProjectDetails 
goal="Identify pain points and opportunities for modernizing jump rope competition operations"
responsibilities="Field research, contextual inquiry, rapid prototyping, solution design"
duration="3 days on-site + follow-up"
/>

USA Jump Rope is the largest jump rope organization in the United States, running events nationwide that culminate in the annual Jump Rope Nationals. Their processes were outdated and starting to show serious strain.

I partnered with [RGLR Collective](http://rglrcollective.com) to conduct field research at Jump Rope Nationals in Florida. Through rapid contextual inquiries with leadership, athletes, and staff, I uncovered critical inefficiencies in their paper-based systems. I designed and prototyped a mobile judging app on-site that would **eliminate manual score runners** and **enable real-time score submission**. The board was enthusiastic about the solution and we developed a roadmap for modernizing the sport.

## Background

### The challenge

USA Jump Rope's operational systems were severely outdated. Their filing system consisted of "a filing cabinet in a storage unit in Alabama," and the entire event ran on paper-based processes that were becoming unsustainable as the sport grew.

### The opportunity

RGLR Collective brought me in to partner on a field research study at Jump Rope Nationals. The goal was to observe the event firsthand, identify problem areas, and propose solutions for modernizing the sport's operations.

### My role

Working as a two-person research team, I conducted rapid-fire contextual inquiries and designed solutions in real-time. Not knowing much about sports in general, I had to quickly become an expert while the event was happening.

## Discovery

### Understanding the event through observation

My research partner and I immersed ourselves in the event, conducting contextual inquiries with leadership, athletes, and support staff. We focused on understanding how the competition actually operated.

### The runner system: A critical inefficiency

One observation stood out immediately. Each athlete competes at one of nine stations, observed by three judges. After an event, three "runners" physically walk to each station, write down the judges' scores on paper, and then carry them to a volunteer who types each score into an Access database.

This manual process created multiple problems:
- Delays in posting results
- Potential for transcription errors  
- Inefficient use of volunteer resources
- Bottlenecks during high-volume competition times

### Rapid synthesis in the field

We synthesized our findings in real-time, turning quotes and observations into insights to build a narrative. Using post-it notes backstage, we identified patterns and opportunities.

## Solution design

### Identifying the highest-impact opportunity

Through affinity diagramming, my research partner and I determined that digitizing the judging process would have the highest impact with the lowest investment. This single change could eliminate the runner system entirely.

### Designing a mobile judging app

That morning at the event, I began designing a mobile prototype backstage to address the specific needs of the judging experience. The solution needed to be simple enough for judges of all technical abilities while being robust enough to handle the complexity of scoring.

## The prototype

### Key features of the judging app

I created a functional prototype in InVision to demonstrate the flow and interactions:

#### Automatic event detection
Using geofencing and GPS, the app automatically detects an event's location and allows judges to join instantly. It identifies the current competition and lets judges indicate their station immediately.

#### Real-time jump tabulation
During events, judges track each individual jumper and compare counts with other judges, replacing physical counters with a digital interface.

#### Instant score submission
Scores are recorded and submitted directly to a centralized database, eliminating runners and manual data entry while keeping competitions moving seamlessly.

### System architecture vision

Beyond the judging app, I proposed a comprehensive event software suite that would automatically communicate with a centralized server, replacing disparate paper processes with an integrated digital system.

## Results and next steps

### Pitching the board of directors

After the event, I met with the board and presented the software solution. They were extremely enthusiastic about the potential to modernize their operations.

### Developing a roadmap

Working with RGLR Collective, we developed a comprehensive proposal and roadmap for implementation. Our presentation included design principles and a phased approach to digital transformation.

## Reflection

This project demonstrated the power of embedded field research and rapid prototyping. By being on-site and designing in context, I could create solutions that addressed real operational pain points rather than assumed problems.

The experience reinforced that sometimes the best insights come from simply watching how things actually work, then using design to imagine how they could work better. In just three days, we identified a path to modernize an entire sport's operations.

The board's enthusiasm validated our approach. While implementation timelines remain in discussion, the research and prototypes created a clear vision for USA Jump Rope's digital future.
